My first Repository

My Hobbies: Music and Dancing

My first day on GitHub Today I learned that version controll is an essential part of my career as web developer. Some keywords that i should remember for later are: git, GitHub, version control, repository, commit and hash. The next 3 montths will be a very exciting time, as I will learn new things every day.
